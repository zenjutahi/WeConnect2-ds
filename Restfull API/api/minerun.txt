SET FLASK_CONFIG=development
SET FLASK_APP=run.py

apiryI used to fancy myself a developer but after the two weeks in the bootcamp i realize i have a lot to learn. this means that either 

The pressure is real, learning new things and implementing them although i really love that and am enjoying the experience
